/**
 * The published server list - a markdown file in the project's repository, one
 * server per line:
 *
 *     [VERSION:NAME:DESCRIPTION:LANGUAGE:IMAGE](host:port@WSPROXY)
 *
 * The version says which client that world is meant to be played with - the
 * token a `versions/<id>` folder gives as `gameVersion.listTag`, `S6EP3` for
 * the Season 6 Episode 3 build. It matters because the base game is compiled
 * against exactly one version, so a world asking for another is one this build
 * cannot enter, and saying so up front beats a protocol that falls apart after
 * the connect.
 *
 * Version, banner and proxy are all optional; a line carrying none of them is
 * the original three-field form and still parses.
 *
 * Directly under its line, a world may list names for its game servers and
 * their channels, which the connect server's protocol has no room for:
 *
 *     [S6EP3:Somewhere:A world:en](example.net)
 *     - 0: Valhalla
 *       - 0: Peaceful
 *       - 1: Hard
 *
 * The outer id is the server group (`ServerId >> 8`) and the inner one the id
 * inside it (the low byte) - the number the game server was configured with,
 * which for a world that never set up groups is the whole of its `ServerId`.
 * Whatever is left unnamed keeps the numbered default.
 *
 * *Directly* is the whole rule: the first line that is not one of these ends
 * the block. Names are indented bullets and this file is prose with examples
 * in it, so a run that has to touch its own entry is a run that cannot drift
 * onto somebody else's world.
 *
 * The target is either `host:port` - the connect server as the world's proxy
 * reaches it - or the world's domain on its own, which leaves the addresses to
 * the convention in `serverServices.ts`.
 *
 * Fetched once per launch so a player who has never edited a setting still has
 * somewhere to play, and cached so the launch after that shows the same list
 * before the network answers (or without a network at all).
 *
 * It is fetched from `raw.githubusercontent.com`, not from the `blob/` page: a
 * blob URL serves GitHub's HTML and no CORS header, so the browser could not
 * read it even if it wanted to.
 *
 * The list is **untrusted text from the internet**. Every line goes through the
 * same normalisers a typed field does, and a line that does not parse is
 * dropped rather than repaired - a list nobody can edit into a broken client is
 * worth more than one that shows every row.
