 *      consts.ts) - the seed of the first profile on a fresh install.
 *
 * Note what the ws address is *not*: a browser cannot open a TCP socket, so
 * every connection goes through the ws↔TCP proxy (`proxy/main.ts`), which
 * dials `?host=&port=` for us. `wsUrl` is therefore the proxy's own address,

/**
 * Where the game-server socket goes, and where it goes if that fails.
 *
 * `ConnectionInfo` carries the address the server wants us on - right for a
 * real deployment, where the game servers are separate boxes. But the address a
 * server advertises is how it believes the *internet* reaches it, which is a
 * different question from how the proxy reaches it, and the two disagree in one
 * very common setup: a server on this machine, or on this network, announcing
 * the public IP of its router. OpenMU's demo does exactly that.
 *
 * So a public address is believed only when the connect server we just spoke to
 * was itself public. Reached OpenMU on `127.0.0.1` and it answers with a public
 * IP? That IP is this same machine seen from outside; going out to the router
 * and back - if the router even hairpins - is at best a slow way to reach a
 * server that is right here, so the loopback address is used at once. Two
 * private addresses, on the other hand, are two boxes on one network: believed.
 *
 * Every such judgement is a guess about someone else's network, so it is never
 * final: `fallback` is the address that lost, and the store tries it if the
 * winner does not answer. Whichever way the guess goes, both get a turn.
